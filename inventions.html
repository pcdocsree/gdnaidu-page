                <h2 id="electric-motor">Electric Motor (1920)</h2>
                <p>Naidu's first major invention was an electric motor that could operate on both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) power supplies. This dual-capability motor was revolutionary for its time and demonstrated Naidu's deep understanding of electrical principles despite his lack of formal education.</p>
                
                <p>The motor found immediate applications in small industries and agricultural pumps, reducing dependence on imported motors. Naidu established a manufacturing unit for these motors in Coimbatore, which became the foundation for India's indigenous electrical equipment industry.</p>
                
                <h2 id="indigenous-car">Indigenous Motor Vehicle (1937)</h2>
                <p>In 1937, Naidu created India's first fully indigenous motor vehicle. The car featured several innovative designs:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Dual-fuel engine capable of running on both petrol and kerosene</li>
                    <li>Locally manufactured chassis and body</li>
                    <li>Custom-designed transmission system</li>
                    <li>Improved suspension for Indian road conditions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The vehicle was demonstrated at the Madras Automobile Exhibition in 1937, where it received widespread acclaim. Despite interest from industrialists, Naidu did not commercialize the vehicle on a large scale, focusing instead on other inventions.</p>
                
                <h2 id="razor">Rasant Electric Razor (1940)</h2>
                <p>The Rasant electric razor was one of Naidu's consumer-oriented inventions. Powered by dry cells, it was designed to be affordable and maintenance-free. The razor featured:</p>

<h2>Electric Motors and Industrial Machines</h2>
<p>
One of Naidu’s major contributions was the development and improvement of electric motors
suitable for Indian conditions. He worked on designs that were robust, efficient, and easier
to maintain, helping industries in and around Coimbatore to adopt electric power more
effectively. His work contributed to the growth of mills, workshops, and small industries
that relied on reliable motors and machinery.
</p>

<h2>Indigenous Car Project</h2>
<p>
Naidu is widely remembered for his efforts to build an indigenous car in India at a time
when almost all automobiles were imported. He worked on designing and fabricating parts
locally, experimenting with materials and engine configurations that Indian workshops could
produce. Although his car did not go into mass production, the project was a significant
early attempt at building a fully Indian-made vehicle and inspired later automotive efforts
in the country.
</p>

<h2>Transport and Bus Services</h2>
<p>
Understanding the need for reliable public transport, Naidu entered the transport sector
and helped establish organised bus services in the Coimbatore region. His buses were known
for being well-maintained and punctual. He introduced systematic maintenance practices and
emphasised safety, which improved the quality of public transport and set a standard for
others to follow.
</p>

<h2>Precision Instruments and Devices</h2>
<p>
Naidu was also interested in creating precision instruments and practical devices for
everyday use. Over his lifetime, he is said to have worked on or influenced designs for a
variety of items, including measuring instruments, household gadgets, and industrial tools.
His approach was always the same: make technology simpler, more affordable, and better
suited to local needs.
