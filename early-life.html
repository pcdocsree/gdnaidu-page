                <h2 id="childhood">Childhood</h2>
                <p>Gopalaswamy Doraiswamy Naidu was born on 23 March 1893 in Kalangal, a small village near Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. He was the son of Gopalaswamy, a school teacher, and Lakshmi Ammal. Naidu's family belonged to a modest agricultural community, and he grew up in humble surroundings that would later shape his practical approach to engineering.</p>
                
                <p>From an early age, Naidu displayed an exceptional curiosity about mechanical devices. He would often dismantle household items and attempt to reassemble them, much to the concern of his parents. His fascination with machinery began when he first saw a British-made steam engine at a nearby railway station.</p>
                
                <h2 id="early-education">Early Education</h2>
                <p>Naidu's formal education was limited due to family circumstances. He attended the local village school but could not complete his secondary education. Despite this, he developed a keen interest in mathematics and physics through self-study. Naidu would borrow textbooks from wealthier students and study them late into the night.</p>
                
                <h2 id="first-jobs">First Jobs</h2>
                <p>At the age of 15, Naidu took his first job as a timekeeper at the British India Corporation in Coimbatore. This position exposed him to various industrial machines and sparked his interest in electrical engineering. During his spare time, he would study the factory's electrical systems and experiment with small electrical devices.</p>
                
                <p>In 1914, Naidu moved to Madras (now Chennai) where he worked as a mechanic for a British engineering firm. This experience provided him with hands-on training in machine tools, electrical wiring, and mechanical assembly - skills that would prove invaluable in his future inventions.</p>
                
                <h2 id="technical-interest">Technical Interest Development</h2>
                <p>During his time in Madras, Naidu began experimenting with electrical motors in his small rented room. With limited resources, he would salvage parts from discarded machines and assemble them into functional devices. His breakthrough came in 1920 when he successfully built his first electric motor capable of operating on both AC and DC power.</p>
                
                <p>This achievement marked the beginning of Naidu's career as an inventor. Despite having no formal engineering degree, his practical knowledge and innovative thinking earned him recognition in engineering circles. He returned to Coimbatore in 1922 and established his first workshop, where he would go on to create over 100 inventions.</p>

  <h2>Early Struggles</h2>
  <p>
    As a teenager, Naidu took up various small jobs to support himself. He worked as a farm
    helper, cleaner and later as a worker in workshops and factories around Coimbatore.
    These experiences gave him hands-on exposure to mechanical equipment and tools. He
    carefully observed how machines were assembled, repaired, and maintained, and he began
    experimenting on his own in his spare time.
  </p>

  <h2>First Steps into Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    Even without an engineering degree, Naidu trained himself by watching others, reading
    available manuals, and learning from trial and error. His ability to diagnose faults and
    fix machines quickly gained attention. This practical, self-taught engineering mindset
    became a defining feature of his career. His early life laid the foundation for his later
    inventions and business ventures, proving that determination and curiosity could
    overcome the lack of formal schooling.
