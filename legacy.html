  <h2>Impact on Coimbatore</h2>
  <p>
    G. D. Naidu played a key role in shaping Coimbatore’s identity as an industrial city. His
    businesses, transport services, and technical experiments attracted other entrepreneurs
    and engineers to the region. As industries grew, so did employment and economic activity.
    Many people in Coimbatore still remember him not only as an inventor but as a builder of
    the city’s industrial backbone.

<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Contribution to Education and Training</h2>
  <p>
    Naidu believed strongly in practical education. He supported technical training and
    encouraged young people to gain hands-on skills, not just exam marks. He helped create
    environments where students could work with real machines, tools, and instruments. His
    emphasis on practical learning influenced how technical education developed in the region
    and inspired institutions that focus on engineering and vocational training.

<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Recognition and Honors</h2>
  <p>
    Over time, Naidu’s achievements earned him recognition across India. He was often referred
    to as the “Edison of India” because, like Thomas Edison, he combined invention with
    entrepreneurship and brought new technologies into everyday use. He received several
    honours for his work and contributions to industry and society. Even after his passing in
    1974, his name continues to be associated with creativity, hard work, and innovation.

  <h2>GD Naidu Museum</h2>
  <p>
    Today, his legacy is preserved through the GD Naidu Museum in Coimbatore, which showcases a
    collection of scientific instruments, vehicles, and historical artefacts. The museum
    reflects his passion for technology and serves as an educational space where visitors can
    learn about scientific principles, engineering history, and Naidu’s own experiments. It
    stands as a tribute to his lifelong dedication to innovation and learning.
